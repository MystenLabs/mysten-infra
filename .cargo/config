# Collection of project wide clippy lints. This is done via an alias because
# clippy doesn't currently allow for specifiying project-wide lints in a
# configuration file. This is a similar workaround to the ones presented here:
# <https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-ecosystem/issues/59>
xclippy = [
    "clippy", "--all-targets", "--",
    "-Wclippy::all",
    "-Wclippy::disallowed_methods",
]
xlint = "run --package x --bin x -- lint"
